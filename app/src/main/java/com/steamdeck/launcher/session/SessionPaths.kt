 *       device.txt     what this device is, and every setting the session ran with

 *       wayland.log    the app's compositor
 *       steam.log      the Steam client's own log, scrubbed  (Steam mode)
 *       steam/         the rest of the client's logs, scrubbed  (Steam mode)
 *       desktop.log    labwc, the panel and the programs on it  (desktop mode)

 * service starts the session - so both write into the same one, and a recreated activity (a
 * foldable opening mid-session) joins the folder in progress instead of opening another.
